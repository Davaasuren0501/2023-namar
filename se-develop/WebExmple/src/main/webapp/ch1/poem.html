    Roses are red
    Violets are blue
    This could be a poem
    But not a haiku
        
    A haiku has a fixed structure. The first line has five
    syllables, the second line has seven syllables and the
    third line has five syllables. Therefore, the previous
    poem cannot be a haiku.
